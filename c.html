<div class="c"><p>Say yes to shopping online for your wedding dress! <br> Many beloved retailers now offer well-curated bridal collections that include everything you needfor your walk down the aisle. Whether you want to go the ready-to-wear route or are looking for something non-traditional, it's easier than ever to find a wedding gown (or a mini dress, separates, or suit) that fits your style, body type, and budget.</p> </div></div>

<p>Brides on a budget, we've got you covered! Lulus is our go-to online store for on-trend wedding dresses that won't break the bank. Bridal designs in graphic lace,<br> dreamy organza, and body-skimming stretch knit will only set you back $100 or less. Besides the affordable prices, we love how easy it is to shop the site. Lulus organizes its designs into different dress codes, fabrics, <br>and styles (think boho vs modern). One of the disadvantages of online shopping is getting overwhelmed by too many options, but Lulus lets us focus on just what we are looking for. And whenever a dress we like is out of stock, the site recommends nearly identical styles to shop.</p></div>
